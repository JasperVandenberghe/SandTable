# SandTable

Code for a Sisyphus sand table.

## Patterns
This folder contains both the processed and pending patters. After completing a pattern, it will be moved to the "processed" folder and a new pattern from the "new" folder will be used.
Patterns are generated using sandify.org

## Erasers
Just as with patterns, erasers are placed in 2 different folders. Erasers are more simple patterns to quickly erase a previous drawing.

## Hardware
Following hardware is used for the project:
- Raspberry Pi 4B
- TMC2208 stepper drivers
- NEMA17 stepper motors
- WS2815 addressable LEDs
